   - Confirm understanding of requirements
   - Check dependencies are completed

2. **During Iteration:**
   - Work through tasks sequentially
   - Test as you go (don't wait until end)
   - Commit code frequently
   - Document any deviations from plan

3. **After Iteration:**
   - Run all testing checklist items
   - Verify all deliverables are complete
   - Document any issues or blockers
   - Update the walkthrough and what had done, what kind of problem occurs and how to solved in Progress.md file(if not exist create for first ever run)
   - Discuss before moving to next iteration

4. **Git Workflow:**
   - Create feature branch for each iteration
   - Commit with clear messages
   - Merge to main after iteration review
   - Tag releases (v0.1, v0.2, etc.)

5. **Communication:**
   - Stop and discuss if requirements are unclear
   - Ask questions before making assumptions
   - Report blockers immediately
