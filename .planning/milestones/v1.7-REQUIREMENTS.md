# Requirements: QM System

**Defined:** 2026-02-11
**Core Value:** Users can reliably create purchase orders, receive inventory, and track request status with full documentation and audit trails.

## v1.7 Requirements

Requirements for v1.7 Stock-Out Request Logic Repair. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Execution

- [x] **EXEC-01**: Each approved stock-out line item has its own Execute button (independent of other items) — Phase 35
- [x] **EXEC-02**: Executing one line item does not affect other approved items in the same request — Phase 35

### Transaction Linking

- [x] **LINK-01**: Stock-out approval propagates qmhq_id to inventory transactions — Phase 34 (auto-populate trigger)
- [x] **LINK-02**: QMHQ item detail shows linked stock-out transactions (via QMHQ → SOR → execution) — Phase 33

### Reference Display

- [x] **REF-01**: Stock-out transactions show SOR ID as primary reference — Phase 33
- [x] **REF-02**: Stock-out transactions show parent QMHQ ID as secondary reference with clickable link — Phase 33

### QMHQ Metrics

- [x] **METRIC-01**: QMHQ item detail shows requested qty (from SOR line items) — Phase 35
- [x] **METRIC-02**: QMHQ item detail shows approved qty (from approvals) — Phase 35
- [x] **METRIC-03**: QMHQ item detail shows rejected qty (from rejections) — Phase 35
- [x] **METRIC-04**: QMHQ item detail shows executed/fulfilled qty (from stock-out transactions) — Phase 35
- [x] **METRIC-05**: Fulfillment Progress calculates as executed qty / approved qty — Phase 35
- [x] **METRIC-06**: Requested qty is visible alongside the fulfillment progress — Phase 35

## Future Requirements

None — focused repair milestone.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Batch "Execute All" button | Per-line-item execution is the goal; batch can be added later |
| Real-time subscription for execution status | Query invalidation sufficient for internal tool |
| Advisory lock performance tuning | Defer until 10K+ SORs/month |
| Context slider on execution dialog | Execution is a small dialog, not a standalone page |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| LINK-01 | Phase 32/34 | ✓ Complete |
| REF-01 | Phase 33 | ✓ Complete |
| REF-02 | Phase 33 | ✓ Complete |
| LINK-02 | Phase 33 | ✓ Complete |
| EXEC-01 | Phase 35 | ✓ Complete |
| EXEC-02 | Phase 35 | ✓ Complete |
| METRIC-01 | Phase 35 | ✓ Complete |
| METRIC-02 | Phase 35 | ✓ Complete |
| METRIC-03 | Phase 35 | ✓ Complete |
| METRIC-04 | Phase 35 | ✓ Complete |
| METRIC-05 | Phase 35 | ✓ Complete |
| METRIC-06 | Phase 35 | ✓ Complete |

**Coverage:**
- v1.7 requirements: 12 total
- Mapped to phases: 12 (100%)
- Unmapped: 0

**Phase 34 Note:** Phase 34 (Database Trigger Hardening) has no direct requirements mapped to it because it provides infrastructure that enables EXEC-01/02. Success criteria ensure data integrity during per-line execution, which is a prerequisite for Phase 35.
